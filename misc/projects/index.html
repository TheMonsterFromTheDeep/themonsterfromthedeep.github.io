					<h1>Projects</h1>
					<p>This page lists all my major and some of my minor projects. Some of these projects, such as mod3 and vague, have their own Github pages
					   directories. Right now these haven't been developed, but they should be sometime in the future. Some of my projects don't have Github
					   pages, and some are on external websites, such as my Ludum Dare games.
					</p>

					<h3><a class="link" href='/mod3'>mod3</a></h3>
					<p>mod3 is a C++ library that I have wanted to make for a long time but still haven't done very much with. The main
					   goal is to create a library that does a lot of things, which includes both data structures (such as strings) and
					   graphics (which I would like to make support multiple platforms). Right now the only thing mod3 contains is two data
					   structures and an exception class. However, it should hopefully have a lot more in the future.
					</p>

					<h3><a class="link" href='/vague'>vague</a></h3>
					<p>vague is an image editor that I am programming in Java. The reason I am doing it in Java is sort of complicated, but essentially
					   it is because of school. vague, right now, only has very basic ui. I am basing the ui off of Blender to some extent. Essentially,
					   it will be possible to split and join windows, and display various types of controls inside them, including the image editing area,
					   and toolboxes, and other things. I am a pixel artist, so I am going to make it have some sorts of tools that are useful for me. For
					   example, I will make a tool which generates random shades of a color in an area, which can be used to make more interesting organic
					   shapes. One of the other ideas I have is making it possible to create images which can be programmatically skinned with different textures -
					   so for example a character in a 2D video game could have a bunch of textures but only one that actually defined the shape of the body, and
					   it would be possible to programmatically generate the full texture (and any animations, for that matter). I may also make it possible to 
					   rig images to structures which will deform the image, allowing them to be animated, but that will not be anytime soon.

					<h3><a class="link" href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/TheMonsterFromTheDeep/">Ludum Dare</a></h3>
					<p>I have particapated in the Ludum Dare 3 times - the 31st, 32nd, and 33rd. The first game I made was a sandbox game. I was going to add in
					   enemies, but I had very little time left, had never programmed an AI, and realized it would be very difficult to make enemies climb over trees.
					   My sandbox game was sort of cool but really wasn't all that great because you couldn't win. My second game was a game with a spaceship and bees.
					   The spaceship shot bees and there were enemies. My AI was glitchy (well, more that I hadn't programmed smooth movement from certain states, so
					   the ships would teleport) and again, there was no win condition, but I had fun because I made spaceships, planets, shops, enemies, and a radar at 
					   the bottom that looked okay but for some reason I decided to ruin the graphic with two smaller dials that looked ugly. My third game was called Bitworm
					   and is by far my least complete because I rewrote the movement code multiple times (at least five or so) because it wasn't working and would glitch a lot.
					   It still does glitch in the final release, which is really too bad. Aside from that, there isn't much to do in the game, because I only had time to
					   program in a few little things. Also, none of the tiles would rotate properly, which I didn't know about. And for some reason on every other computer
					   I've played it on the tiles that are supposed to be gray appear pink / reddish. It's sort of weird. Bitworm was one of my coolest games, I think, but
					   sadly it isn't complete enough to be very impressive. If you are going to download one of my games, however, I don't know which one I would recommend.
					   Probably not Little Universe (my space game) because it has no real instructions. Peaceful Night (my sandbox game) has slightly better instructions scrawled
					   in poor handwriting on the title screen. Bitworm has okay instructions, but all the screenshots were taken in a world that looks much different from the one
					   that you actually get to play in, so I'm not sure if they are very easy to understand.
