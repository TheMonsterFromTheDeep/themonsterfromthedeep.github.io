<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
	I am a teenager who browses the internet under the alias TheMonsterFromTheDeep. I am largely a programmer - I have experience in multiple languages, my favorite of which being C++. I work on multiple projects in my free time, such as <a href="https://github.com/TheMonsterFromTheDeep/vague">vague</a>, an image editor / paint program that I am creating in Java. I also participate in <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/TheMonsterFromTheDeep">Ludum Dare</a> periodically, and I like creating and sometimes playing games.<br /><br />
    When I'm not programming, I also like to work in 3D using <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. Right now I am working on a large animated project. I also sometimes compose music using <a href="http://www.beepbox.co/">Beepbox</a> or <a href="https://openmpt.org/">OpenMPT</a>.

<h1>Blog</h1>
<p>
    There are many interesting topics inside and outside of the tech world, and sometimes I simply want to put my thoughts out there. I may or may
    not write anything interesting, so view at your own risk.
