<h2>Welcome!</h2>
Hello! By some bizarre circumstance you have arrived upon my personal Github Pages site.
<br><br>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
On the Internet, I go by "TheMonsterFromTheDeep" (or a slight variation thereof). I am
a teenager whose hobbies include programming and animation. I have both a
<a href=https://github.com/TheMonsterFromTheDeep>GitHub account</a>, where you can find
all of my code, and a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG6vbJT8nUsmjrUUbNX3yBQ>
YouTube account</a>, where you can find my animations.

My most important projects are on the <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> page of this site.
