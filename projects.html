<h1>My Projects</h1>
<p>
    I really like programming. For this reason, I work on a lot of different projects. Here you will find a few of them listed.<br /><br /><br />
    <h2>vague</h2>
    vague is an image editing program that I am working on in Java. It started as a bitmap art program, but it has since become more of a psuedo-vector art program. As of now, it is not very functional - it has a single tool for drawing, which draws lines. It also has the ability to change the color of these lines, but this is basically the limit of its functionality as of now.<br /><br />
    vague is so limited due to multiple decisions that added greatly to the development time. The first of these decisions was to re-write vague from the ground up about 2 months or so into its development. This rewrite was triggered by the ultimate unmaintainability of the code as well as an interesting new user interface that I wanted to implement. This interface is the other reason vague is far behind - it is much more complicated than some other user interfaces.<br /><br />
    vague opens with a blank gray screen. The user then drags the mouse to create draggable and resizable windows. These windows contain various controls. In the current version of vague, only the editor window and tool settings exist as controls.<br /><br />
    vague is based around a 'fluid' user interface scheme. When vague first starts, it is simply a blank canvas. The user then creates windows and controls and starts working on what they want to work on. It is simple to rearrange the workspace and everything is natural. This is also what the editor is based on. When the editor is first opened, all that's there is a blank square. However, this square does not actually represent the size of the image. As the user draws, the image simply expands to accomodate the drawing.<br /><br />
    That's the idea, anyways. In practice, vague currently is not particularly easy to use or particularly fluid.<br /><br />

    <h2>Ludum Dare</h2>
    I have participated in Ludum Dare 4 times now. My first game was an ambitious attempt at a sandbox game. It is mediocre for a first game but I had a lot of fun making it, as sandbox games are incredibly fun to make. My next game, Little Universe, is some sort of space game. The primary weapon of the spaceship is a beehive. The user interface is rather cluttered, but the game is kinda fun and silly. It isn't particularly entertaining, but it certainly has potential. There is a radar in the bottom left corner that shows what is going on around the player. There are various planets, including some that act as shops. There are enemies that spawn and have rudimentary AI, although they sometimes teleport. Little Universe is probably my second-best Ludum Dare game. My third game is not much of a game because I did not get much done with it, despite using most of the time alloted. It is called "Bitworm" and is a simple game with a snake-like player whose tail follows its head in a delayed pattern. It is so undeveloped because I simply could not get the movement to work correctly. In its current state, movement still does not work correctly. My best game by far is my fourth game, Fellowship. Its title is based on a theme that I encountered during Theme Slaughter - "fellowhsip of the whatever." Originally built to involve time travel, the player is a wizard with a purple hat. However, failing time travel, all he has to traverse the land is building and destroying various specific blocks. The player is given no control over the character, only what is built. It is a fast-paced puzzle game. Those that play it tell me that it is very hard. The biggest issue with this game is that I programmed it very poorly, so it is laggy, and that I for whatever reason thought that the theme was "one button controls" when it was actually "two button controls."<br /><br />

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/TheMonsterFromTheDeep/spaghetti">spaghetti / fettuccine</a></h3>
    spaghetti and fettuccine are two versions of a game library that I use for Ludum Dare. They are absolutely horrible to work with, and I recommend against using them for anything that you might do. However, it is incredibly nice to have a framework, even if it is a framework that has some features which work against you. Every time there is a Ludum Dare, I work on this library, normally writing it basically from the ground up, and attempt to make it better than it was last time. Then, when I start Ludum Dare, I find all sorts of flaws in whatever new game library I built, and I end up modifying the library while programming my game.<br /><br />
    I first used spaghetti during my third Ludum Dare. I then modified it and it became fettuccine, which I used during my fourth Ludum Dare. The next version will be called alfredo.
