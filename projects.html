<h1>My Projects</h1>
The vast majority of my projects are things that I am programming just for fun. However, I also have one ongoing animation project.
<br><br>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/TheMonsterFromTheDeep/fads">FADS</a></h2>
FADS is a graphing calculator I am working on for curses-compliant terminals. It is written entirely in C. Right now it is in a
pre-release stage: it is not yet full-featured enough to be released, but it is getting close.
<br><br>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/TheMonsterFromTheDeep/zlib">zLib</a></h3>
zLib is a C library I am developing as a utility library. The reason I am making it is specifically so I can use it for FADS, but it
is general enough that it can be used in other projects. It's most powerful feature is generic dynamic lists - that is, it has functionality
for manipulating lists of any type.
<br><br>
<h2><a href="ludumdare.com/compo/author/TheMonsterFromTheDeep">Ludum Dare</a></h2>
Ludum Dare is a "Game Jam" - a competition where contestants build games from scratch within a small time period - in the case of Ludum Dare, 48 hours.
I participate in the Ludum Dare regularly.
<br><br>
For Ludum Dare, I maintain a game library (so to speak) called <a href="https://github.com/TheMonsterFromTheDeep/Alfredo">Alfredo</a> (based off of my
original Ludum Dare game library, "spaghetti"). In its current state, it is not very pretty - but I tend to work on it before each Ludum Dare, and every
time it improves some slight amount.

This is an animation project I started simply to see what would happen if I tried to make a 2D animation in Blender. Despite the last video being released
about a year ago, I am still working on this project - although I haven't actually done anything with it since about last May. However, it is not dead - I
am planning on finishing the third "episode" soon.
