When learning a text-based programming language, the first thing that anybody does is make their computer say "Hello, world!" or "Hello, World!" or a variant thereof. Of course, anybody who has ever learned a text-based programming language already knows this. Hello world has become a tradition in the programming community.<br /><br />

"Hello, World!" also seems to be a very popular title for tech-oriented blogs. Seeing as I will at least orient part of my new blog, Eyeblog, towards technology, I might as well jump on the bandwagon.<br /><br />

The name for my blog very clearly comes from my ubiquitous icon of an orange eye on a green background. For some reason I have developed TheMonsterFromTheDeep into my internet persona. It is highly likely that if you find an account called "TheMonsterFromTheDeep" or a similar variant, I am the person who owns it.<br /><br />

A very good question to ask is why I should start a blog. There are hundreds of highly interesting blogs out on the internet, and mine will likely not be nearly as interesting as any of them. It seems almost like the Youtube fame trend...<br /><br />

See, Youtube used to simply be a fun site where everybody could share videos with the world. Eventually, however, Youtube partnerships became a really big thing. Large percentages of videos on Youtube are now monetized. People are *making a living* by creating Youtube videos. Some of these people honestly have very interesting content.<br /><br />

However, there are a lot of people who do not have very interesting content. Many others have very effortless content. One of the most absurd jobs that now seems to exist is Let's Play Youtuber. People are earning enough money to live off of by *playing videogames*. Of course, a lot of these people are very good at what they do - people make funny commentary and interact with fans and everybody has a good time.<br /><br />

The problem, then, is because people think that it's really easy to get big on Youtube, everybody makes Let's Play videos. There are hundreds of people that want to get "famous" on Youtube, and so there are hundreds of wannabee Let's Play videos. They are everywhere, and many of them are of incredibly low quality. Almost anybody can record themselves playing a video game. Screen recorders are incredibly popular - lower quality videos always have a screen recorder watermark, while some less ethical people simply pirate screen recorders. Those that are really serious, however, don't simply download a screen recorder and record themselves playing their favorite game. People who have any chance of getting a big channel have entertaining commentary and at least mildy professional videos with at least mildly professional editing. People with a natural talent for speaking have a chance, and people who can practice and develop a skill for speaking might also have a chance. Almost anyone else loses.<br /><br />

How this connects back to blogs is hopefully rather clear. Although I'm not planning on earning money, I would probably like it if people read what I wrote. However, in order for people to care about what it is that I write about, I have to be entertaining and professional. I have to write well. This is not particularly easy. I am not awful at writing - I have read a lot and so I have an intutive grasp of good grammar and mediocre writing. Even so, the things I write are often bumpy - my sentences trip over each other and get tangled and I end up scratching my head wondering why people don't understand what I'm trying to say.<br /><br />

Here's a fun little experiment: If you've read this far, think back over the last few minutes of reading what I have wrote. Were you bored? Tell me below if I've enabled Disqus by the time you read this.<br /><br />

Of course, my blog isn't about the readers. It's about me. I like to write, and I have a lot of things that I want to write about. I have strong opinions on lots of subjects. My blog, in fact, is mostly just a place where I can write about something if I want to tell the internet about it. It is also the perfect place to practice writing skills. Why? Well, the internet is the harshest critic of them all. People all the internet don't have to sugarcoat anything. They can be as callous as they like, and no guilt will hold them back, because they are simply talking to faceless words. In my case, they are talking to an orange eye that happens to be loosely based on Sauron's eye from the Lord of the Rings movies.<br /><br />

I might write a blog post about behavior on the internet in the future...<br /><br />

In any case, the fact is that I have a blog now. Building a blog was fun. I finally looked into Jekyll, and what it is all about, and I ended up thinking that it is awesome. Before I had my website generated using some clunky JavaScript. My old website also was really ugly - that wasn't really a problem that Jekyll could have fixed. The problem is actually that of all the computer-programming-oriented stuff that I know how to do, web design is probably my weakest spot.<br /><br />

For whatever reason, I simply cannot build good-looking *or* functional products using things like HTML. (Well, I can, but not as easily). This is a rather large problem, because the only things that anyone cares about are aesthetics and functionality. In fact, HTML is not the only thing like this - it also applies to things such as widget kits, such as Swing for Java. I can't do very much with Swing; you'll find that my Java programs all implement their [own custom interfaces](https://github.com/TheMonsterFromTheDeep/vague).<br /><br />

I'm not really sure why this might be. Maybe it is because I can't really intuitively understand how HTML is rendered. I think this is probably a big part of it; I will build some HTML and CSS and find out that it renders nothing like I would have expected.<br /><br />

This website itself took a lot of trial and error, and is also really sloppy.<br /><br />

In any case, I am going to shift my focus from how awful my web design skills are to part of my philosophy on web design.<br /><br />

See, I tend to design sites to work on as many browsers as possible. I shun the use of modern things like `<article>` and similar elements. In fact, the main part of HTML5 that I like is the canvas. I don't really like anything else. It took me a while to even start using `inline-block` elements after I heard that they aren't necessarily supported everywhere.<br /><br />

This philosophy is probably where some of my troubles with web design stem from. However, I think it is useful to keep accessiblity in mind when designing a website. My current website is designed to work on most large screens. It doesn't really work on small screens; I still need to design a mobile version of the site.<br /><br />

Anyways, hopefully now you have a sense of what I will be doing on this blog. I realize this post (especially the second half) was incredibly self-centered, which is kinda boring and ranty. I think I'm going to try to avoid that kind of thing in whatever I talk about next.<br /><br />

As a closing thought, I apologize for the external JavaScript that will be loaded on this page. I don't really like websites that load JavaScript from a whole bunch of different sources, but because GitHub Pages only hosts static content, I have to use an external service to have comments. Most people probably don't care, but for those that do, you can simply disable JavaScript.
