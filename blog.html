<h1>Eyeblog</h1>
    As I traverse the internet as a disembodied orange eye, I thought that 'Eyeblog' was an appropriately punny name to use for my personal blog.<br /><br />
    Here you will find anything that I decide would be appropriate to write about. This includes anything from software and technology to philosophy to silly jokes.<br /><br />
    As noted by others on the web, one should not build a website if they have nothing to say. For this reason, I will, of course, attempt to have something interesting to say. However, due to the inherent subjective nature of what constitutes being interesting, the stuff that I write may not be considered as such by others.<br /><br />
    That being said, constructive feedback is always appreciated. You can email me <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">here</a>.'
